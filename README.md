# API-Project-2021
The project is part of the algorithms and principles of informatics course at Polytechnic University of Milan. This project was part of the assessment for the academic year 2020-2021 and it was automatically evaluated by a univerisity platform.

Final score: 30/30 with laude

# Project specification
The project requirement was to rank many graphs that were given as input and give as output the top k found. The score was given by the sum of the shortest path from the starting node and all the other nodes.

The input has 2 integers in the first line: d and k , Respectively the number of nodes of the graphs and the number of top graphs to return.
Furthermore, there were two commands:
- AgguingiGrafo that was used to understand that there would be another graph to rank up.
- TopK that was used to end the computation and request the results.

# Tools used
Clion as development environment
